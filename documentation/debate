Example 1
Motion: This House would transform our current system of government, based on democracy, into one that embodies the values of meritocracy.
Legislative context: Poland.

Actor: Ministry of Education.

Idea: We propose to introduce a competency test to be taken before general elections. On the basis of the result of this test, a citizen’s eligibility to vote would be determined.

Implementation: Responsibility for this policy would rest with the Ministry of Education. The test itself would not be something entirely new; instead, we would reuse the existing matura exam, which every high school student in Poland takes at the end of their basic education. Voting eligibility would be granted to those who pass the matura with a positive result. This eligibility would expire after seven years, after which it would be necessary to retake and pass the exam in order to renew one’s voting rights.

Expected outcomes: Only those who understand the basic workings of the world – knowledge which the matura exam is designed to test – would be allowed to take part in making decisions about that world through voting in general elections. This moves our political system away from pure democracy towards a more meritocratic model.

Feasibility: Implementing this policy is relatively straightforward, as it builds on an existing, well-functioning system. The current framework already allows the matura to be taken at any age and multiple times, so the reform would not require a major redesign of the exam process. Furthermore, the seven-year expiry date would distribute the number of retakes over time, limiting the need to scale up the infrastructure used to administer the test. This policy is unconstitutional.

Risks and by-products: A key risk is that a temporary government might attempt to gain control over the content or grading of the exam in order to favour a particular group of voters. This risk is partially mitigated by the exam’s dual role: it would both qualify high school graduates for university and qualify citizens for elections. This makes it more difficult and politically costly for legislators to manipulate the exam arbitrarily, as such changes would also directly affect access to higher education.

Example 2
Motion: This House would transform our current system of government, based on democracy, into one that embodies the values of meritocracy.
Legislative context: Poland.

Actor: Ministry of Education.

Idea: We propose to establish a formula that multiplies a citizen’s vote in a general election by a factor proportional to that voter’s level of education.

Implementation: Before each election, the multiplier for every voter will be updated, on the assumption that a citizen’s education level may have changed since the last elections. The formula would be as follows: 0 for those without a diploma of basic education; 1 for those with a diploma of basic education; 4 for those with a first level of higher education (bachelor’s degree); 16 for those with a master’s degree; 64 for those with a PhD; and 256 for those with a professor’s title.

Expected outcomes: The more knowledge you have about how the world works, the greater your impact on how it is governed. In this way, political influence is concentrated in the hands of those who are, in principle, better informed.

Feasibility: Such a policy would currently be unconstitutional, but its technical enforcement should be relatively effortless. The relevant data on citizens’ education levels is already collected by the state and could be incorporated into existing voting procedures. Electoral personnel counting votes would have access to a register of multipliers for each voter in their district and would apply the appropriate factor when tallying the results.

Risks and by-products: Voting procedures might require an additional layer of security, as multipliers could be tampered with or misused by bad actors. Moreover, such a policy may lead to a resurgence of class conflict, as a strong sense of inequality and exclusion is likely to develop among those not favoured by the system.

Exercise 1

This House would relax the legal requirements for acquiring Polish citizenship.
Legislative context: Poland.

Exercise 2

This House would recognise 'brain rot' as a disease and introduce legislation to protect society from it.
